USER="ecapan"                          # Define USER variable for general use

# Define the input and output directories:
input_dir="/data/users/${USER}/rna_seq/RNA-sequencing/unsorted_mapped_bam"
output_dir="/data/users/${USER}/rna_seq/RNA-sequencing/sorted_mapped_bam"

# Create the output directory if it doesn't already exist:
mkdir -p ${output_dir}

# Make a list of the unsorted BAM files:
bam_files=($(ls ${input_dir}/*.bam))

# Select the current BAM file based on the job array index:
bam_file=${bam_files[$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID]}

# Define the base name for the output file (basename strips directory and suffix from filenames):
base_name=$(basename ${bam_file} .bam)

# Define temporary prefix for sorting (to avoid large intermediate files in memory):
temp_prefix="${output_dir}/${base_name}_temp"

# Sort the BAM file by genomic coordinates:
apptainer exec --bind /data/ /containers/apptainer/hisat2_samtools_408dfd02f175cd88.sif \
  samtools sort -m 18G -@ 4 -T ${temp_prefix} -o ${output_dir}/${base_name}_sorted.bam ${bam_file}
# -m 18G allocates 18GB memory for each thread (total = ~72GB for 4 threads, leaves about 4625MB buffer for each thread).
#  For these specified unsorted BAM files, the memory amount had to be increased to avoid out-of-memory failures.
# -@ 4 specifies the number of threads to use (here 4).
# -T specifies the prefix for temporary files used during sorting. The temporary files will be saved (and later deleted) in the /tmp/ directory.
# -o specifies the output file (the sorted BAM file).

# Check exit status of samtools and log success/failure:
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "$(date): Sorting completed successfully for ${bam_file}" >> ${output_dir}/sort_success.log
else
  echo "$(date): Sorting failed for ${bam_file}" >> ${output_dir}/sort_error.log
fi
# $? holds the exit status of the most recently executed command (in this case, the exit status of samtools sort).
#    0 means the command completed successfully. Non-zero values (e.g., 1, 2) indicate that something went wrong.
#    After samtools sort runs, successes are written to sort_success.log and failures are written to sort_error.log.
#    With this, silent failures can be avoided. If a file wasnâ€™t sorted properly, it will show in the log file.
# ${date} creates timestamps for better tracking.

# Remove temporary files after the job is completed:
rm -rf ${temp_prefix}*
